{"name":"Node-restful","tagline":"A library for quickly providing a data api","body":"[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/baugarten/node-restful.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/baugarten/node-restful)\r\n\r\nnode-restful\r\n============\r\n\r\nCreate awesome APIs using express.\r\n\r\nRegister mongoose resources and default RESTful routes are automatically made\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar express = require('express'),\r\n    restful = require('node-restful'),\r\n    mongoose = restful.mongoose;\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\nvar Resource = restful.model('resource', mongoose.Schema({\r\n    title: 'string',\r\n    year: 'number',\r\n  })\r\n  .methods(['get', 'post', 'put', 'delete']);\r\n\r\nResource.register(app, '/resources');\r\n\r\napp.listen(3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegisters the following routes:\r\n\r\n    GET /resources\r\n    GET /resources/:id\r\n    POST /resources\r\n    PUT /resources/:id\r\n    DELETE /resources/:id\r\n\r\nwhich do exactly what you think they do!\r\n\r\nThe best part is that `restful.model` returns a Mongoose model, so you can interact with it the same way that you're already accustomed to! (i.e. `new Resource`, `Resource.findById`, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install node-restful\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThere is a good example application under examples/movies.\r\n\r\nI will also show some features and use cases for them, how to set up routes, etc.\r\n\r\n### API\r\n\r\nThere are a few functions that are available after we register the mongoose schema. The first one we already saw. \r\n\r\n`.methods([...])` takes a list of methods that should be available on the resource. Future calls to methods will override previously set values\r\nTo disallow `delete` operations, simply run\r\n\r\n```js\r\nResource.methods(['get', 'post', 'put'])\r\n```\r\n    \r\nWe can also run custom routes. We can add custom routes by calling `.route(path, handler)`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nResource.route('recommend', function(req, res, next) {\r\n  res.send('I have a recommendation for you!');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will set up a route at `/resources/recommend`, which will be called on all HTTP methods. We can also restrict the HTTP method by adding it to the path:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nResource.route('recommend.get', function(req, res, next) {\r\n   res.send('GET a recommendation');\r\n});\r\nResource.route('recommend', ['get', 'put', 'delete'], function(req, res, next) { ... });\r\n```\r\n    \r\nOr do some combination of HTTP methods.\r\n\r\nNow. Lets say we have to run arbitrary code before or after a route. Lets say we need to hash a password before a POST or PUT operation. Well, easy.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nResource.before('post', hash_password)\r\n  .before('put', hash_password);\r\n      \r\nfunction hash_password(req, res, next) {\r\n  req.body.password = hash(req.body.password);\r\n  next();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoy. That was easy. What about doing stuff after request, but before its sent back to the user? Restful stores the bundle of data to be returned in `res.locals` (see [express docs](http://expressjs.com/api.html#res.locals)). `res.locals.status_code` is the returned status code and `res.locals.bundle` is the bundle of data. In every before and after call, you are free to modify these are you see fit!\r\n\r\n```js\r\nResource.after('get', function(req, res, next) {\r\n  var tmp = res.locals.bundle.title; // Lets swap the title and year fields because we're funny!\r\n  res.locals.bundle.title = res.locals.bundle.year;\r\n  res.locals.bundle.year = tmp;\r\n  next(); // Don't forget to call next!\r\n});\r\n    \r\nResource.after('recommend', do_something); // Runs after all HTTP verbs\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is all great. But up until now we've really only talked about defining list routes, those at `/resources/route_name`. We can also define detail routes. Those look like this\r\n\r\n```js\r\nResource.route('moreinfo', {\r\n    detail: true,\r\n    handler: function(req, res, next) {\r\n        // req.params.id holds the resource's id\r\n        res.send(\"I'm at /resources/:id/moreinfo!\")\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nI don't think this is the prettiest, and I'd be open to suggestions on how to beautify detail route definition...\r\n\r\nAnd that's everything for now!\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nYou can view the issue list for what I'm working on, or contact me to help!\r\n\r\nJust reach out to [me](https://github.com/baugarten)\r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 by Ben Augarten\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
